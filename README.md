# Geolocation Project

![I think I don't get it](https://i.imgflip.com/kw17v.jpg)

This week's project is about coordinates, locating different places and calculating distances.

## How? ðŸ¤”

I have used:

- Mongodb
- Foursquare API
- Pandas, lots of pandas
- Folium
- A lot of patience

## What did I do?

- Mongodb queries to select the dataset I was going to work with.
- Filter and clean the previous dataset.
- Make requests to the Foursquare API to obtain a dataset with coordinates, which meets certain conditions.
- Display the results obtained from the API and the original dataset.


## What you are going to find ðŸ¤“

Three different jupyters:

- mongo: where are the queries to mongodb, dataset filtered and cleaned.
- getting info: where are all the requests to Foursquare API, dataset filtered and cleaned.
- finally: merge of both datasets from the two jupyters above, displaying of all coordinates.
